2014-09-17 NUTsqlite-1.1 released.

2014-09-15 Forgot that calorie change from Calorie Auto-Set will not provoke
           auto portion control processing because calories not a PCF nutrient.
           Added auto_cal calls if calories change in AcceptNewMeasurements.

2014-09-10 AcceptNewMeasurements not working right because sql is not updating
           global variables from the proc.  No idea why not.  Added redundant
           call to RefreshWeightLog to update vars and it worked.  No idea why.

2014-09-10 Fixed spelling errors in nutdoc.html.  Made updateNUT.tcl delete
           from tcl_code before loading new code.

2014-09-07 NUTsqlite-1.0 released.
