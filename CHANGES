2017-02-22 NUTsqlite-1.9.9.4 released.

2017-02-21 GUI not right for case when Calories are set to "adjust to my meals"
           so I changed procs InitializePersonalOptions and 
           ChangePersonalOptions to allow right fat and non-fiber carb choices.

2016-11-30 In proc theusualAdd, order by Shrt_Desc instead of Long_Desc so meal
           list menu looks more like it knows what it is doing.

2016-10-22 NUTsqlite-1.9.9.3 released.

2016-09-26 Changed AcceptNewMeasurements to return calorie auto-set feature to
           way it was originally, because it worked better to preserve lean
           mass.  However, now an auto-set cycle ends with a reset of calories
           to the average during the cycle in order to damp down big
           oscillations.

2016-08-16 NUTsqlite-1.9.9.2 released.

2016-08-16 Line 2128 in proc PCF has the constant that controls the accuracy of
           automatic portion control; however, if it is too accurate the
           algorithm starts to loop often, which seems to be the case now, so I
           loosened it from 0.1 to 0.2.

2016-05-30 NUTsqlite-1.9.9.1 released.

2016-05-16 On calorie auto-set when both fat mass and lean mass are going up,
           and lean mass is going up faster than fat mass, treat this as a
           favorable trend.  Change to proc AcceptNewMeasurements.

2016-05-12 NUTsqlite-1.9.9.0 released.

2016-05-12 Fixed coding mistake in proc update_am that only manifested if user
           changed meals per day with no meals in the database.

2016-05-08 NUTsqlite-1.9.8 released.

2016-05-07 Mac user showed me illegible screens because Mac OS does not honor
           themed widgets.  Made Mac and Windows gui (appSize = 0.0) monochrome.

2016-03-18 NUTsqlite-1.9.7 released.

2016-03-02 Changed calorie auto-set feature to immediately end cycle if fat
           mass is going up or both lean and fat are going down.  This gets
           rid of long cycles with a big dive at the beginning and then an
           extended effort to get lean mass back up.  These long cycles when
           they occur are just too stressful and don't accomplish anything.

2015-09-30 NUTsqlite-1.9.6 released.  Verified it works with sr28.

2015-09-12 Some of the confusion installing on a Mac appears to be that their
           unzip of multiple files puts the files in yet another separate
           directory.  I changed the README to explicitly say this, and I added
           a line in nut.tcl that allows the user to cd to some directory
           before anything happens.  The Mac Tcl launcher doesn't pick a good
           working directory, and this can easily solve that problem.

2015-08-02 NUTsqlite-1.9.5 released.

2015-08-02 Changed font on analog clock in alternate GUI load screen.  It
           scales better even if it is slightly less classy.

2015-08-01 I've changed my mind on how calorie auto-set should work.  It now
           will not allow fat mass to go up.  I finally found the backup of
           my old historical weight logs, and this is how I got the best
           results except when I was eating very high carb.  These changes are
           in proc AcceptNewMeasurements.

2015-07-15 NUTsqlite-1.9.4 released.

2015-07-14 The original GUI works well on Windows and Mac, so it is retained if
           the appSize variable in nut.tcl is 0.0; however, on Linux when there
           there is no resolution-independent window manager, it does not scale
           well.  Therefore, I wrote an alternate GUI that is invoked when
           appSize is greater than 0.0.  Some of the widgets work differently
           due to the needs of the different geometry manager employed, but the
           size and appearance are now more consistent over the whole range of
           screen resolutions and "appSize" settings.

2015-07-10 In proc format_meal_id there is a call to the Tcl math func "int"
           that erroneously blows up if you pass it the string "08" which it
           thinks is a malformed octal number, so I had to put in a workaround.

2015-06-13 NUTsqlite-1.9.3 released.

2015-06-13 Changed proc AcceptNewMeasurements.  wlpolarity not being changed
           due to coding error.  Upshot would be that user continually loses
           weight unto frailty although bodyfat percentage improves markedly.
           This bug was only seen when using the calorie auto-set feature.  

2015-02-06 Changed proc n6hufa.  It was counting trans fats twice.  Left trans
           in the argument list to avoid making users have to reload the 
           database to recreate the views.  This error is insignificant because
           it can only slightly change essential fatty acid daily values.

2015-01-08 NUTsqlite-1.9.2 released.

2015-01-08 In proc SetDefanalLater, the attempt to change to a watch cursor and
           update the screen isn't working right because it may change the value
           reported by the spin button in Analyze Meals after it has been
           verified, so that there is an error pop-up.  Performance is better
           since I wrote this part, so I just removed the whole sequence as it
           takes only a second or so even with 1200 meals, although there is
           some unexplained flickering if there is auto portion control in 
           effect.  Also, commented out the prepared statement cache set to 100
           because it may be that it is slowing down the program if it runs for
           several days; however, don't know for sure because it always takes
           several days to test.

2014-12-18 NUTsqlite-1.9.1 released.

2014-12-18 Fixed proc auto_cal to make OMEGA6, AA, and LA daily values have >
           0.0 daily values in cases where food has none and we get a error
           pop-up basically complaining about division by zero.

2014-11-07 NUTsqlite-1.9.0 released.

2014-11-07 Just for laughs, I upgraded all my Tcl stuff with the ActiveTcl
           distribution.  There were a few changes in the appearance of the gui
           which I fixed in such a manner that earlier versions of Tcl shouldn't
           notice:  a literal green on food search became an illegible darkGreen
           so I specified it using rgb notation, and some zeros at the top of
           view foods became negative zeros so I explicitly set them to zero
           before the spinbuttons create themselves.  Also, the "Load Nutrient
           Values" progress bar needed to be retimed.

2014-10-30 NUTsqlite-1.8 released.

2014-10-30 Another problem with recipes:  traces on variables to allow
           modifications of nutrient values not properly turned on in
           RecipeSaveAs or turned off in RecipeCancel, leading to endless
           processing after a second recipe is attempted.  Fixed, hopefully.
           The recipe feature was the last thing I wrote when I was trying to
           finish the program and I think I was tired.

2014-10-28 Moved SQL prepared statement cache up to the max 100.  There doesn't
           seem to be any cost to this, and this is what I would do if I were
           coding in C.  Also, made the RecipeSaveAs SQL a single transaction.

2014-10-27 Added window icon.  It doesn't make a lot of sense since this icon is
           the graph from the legacy version that I didn't implement in this
           version.

2014-10-12 NUTsqlite-1.7 released.

2014-10-12 Pressing a food button on "Record Meals" is not necessarily producing
           the same quantity when the food opens up in "View Foods".  Fixed
           proc rm2vf.

2014-10-05 Made all the {nut}dv variables round the same way as the {nut}am
           variables to remove inconsistencies in auto portion control, i.e.
           ::FATdv keeps firing because it it is not exactly equal to ::FATam.

2014-10-03 Removed redundant dv_change call in proc ChangePersonalOptions.
           Write to {nut}opt variable will take care of it because of traces on
           all the {nut}opt variables.

2014-10-03 NUTsqlite-1.6 released.

2014-10-03 Removed redundant SQL processing from proc update_am in case where
           user types giant number that resolves to all the meals in the db.

2014-10-03 A Windows and Mac user had to set appSize to 0.0.  So I guess I will
           distribute it set to 0.0 and make the Linux people be the ones who
           have to edit nut.tcl to change it.

2014-09-30 NUTsqlite-1.5 released.

2014-09-30 Added goofy acknowledgement message after updateNUT.tcl processing.

2014-09-30 Fixed the meal choice scale and food search widgets from changing
           their positions when going from meal to analysis in record meals.

2014-09-29 View pcf changed to temp.  Although NUT wasn't designed to work to
           with multiple instances sharing the same db, they shouldn't actively
           interfere if it can be helped, and pcf view won't be shared if it's
           temp.

2014-09-29 Heh heh, RecipeDone still doesn't work right.  Made random changes in
           hopes it will start to work.  My usual superficial testing confirms
           it may work, but maybe not.

2014-09-27 Added code to work with older Tcl/Tk/SQLite installations circa 2009
           that don't have SQLite restore and backup commands.

2014-09-26 NUTsqlite-1.4 released.

2014-09-26 Speeded up automatic portion control by making it a single SQL
           transaction.

2014-09-26 Speeded up proc SetDefanal slightly by cancelling previous calls on
           event loop and making shorter the time allowed for user spinbuttoning
           until SQL processing kicks in.

2014-09-25 Fixed setPCF to correctly show no portion control when it is
           obviously impossible.

2014-09-24 NUTsqlite-1.3 released.
 
2014-09-24 In some cases when carb or fat is set in personal options to "adjust
           to my meals" there is an error dialog when the nutrient is selected
           for automatic portion control.  Fixed in proc setPCF.

2014-09-18 NUTsqlite-1.2 released.

2014-09-18 Recipe scaling for water gained or lost in preparation is wrong.
           Nothing is happening.  RecipeDone changed.  Removed "-strict" from
           checking for doubles and fixed weight assignment that had wrong
           syntax.

2014-09-18 Recipe NDB_No starting too low in vicinity of USDA NDB_Nos.  Should
           start at 99000.  RecipeSaveAs changed.

2014-09-17 NUTsqlite-1.1 released.

2014-09-15 Forgot that calorie change from Calorie Auto-Set will not provoke
           auto portion control processing because calories not a PCF nutrient.
           Added auto_cal calls if calories change in AcceptNewMeasurements.

2014-09-10 AcceptNewMeasurements not working right because sql is not updating
           global variables from the proc.  No idea why not.  Added redundant
           call to RefreshWeightLog to update vars and it worked.  No idea why.

2014-09-10 Fixed spelling errors in nutdoc.html.  Made updateNUT.tcl delete
           from tcl_code before loading new code.

2014-09-07 NUTsqlite-1.0 released.
