2014-09-26 NUTsqlite-1.4 released.

2014-09-26 Speeded up automatic portion control by making it a single SQL
           transaction.

2014-09-26 Speeded up proc SetDefanal slightly by cancelling previous calls on
           event loop and making shorter the time allowed for user spinbuttoning
           until SQL processing kicks in.

2014-09-25 Fixed setPCF to correctly show no portion control when it is
           obviously impossible.

2014-09-24 NUTsqlite-1.3 released.
 
2014-09-24 In some cases when carb or fat is set in personal options to "adjust
           to my meals" there is an error dialog when the nutrient is selected
           for automatic portion control.  Fixed in proc setPCF.

2014-09-18 NUTsqlite-1.2 released.

2014-09-18 Recipe scaling for water gained or lost in preparation is wrong.
           Nothing is happening.  RecipeDone changed.  Removed "-strict" from
           checking for doubles and fixed weight assignment that had wrong
           syntax.

2014-09-18 Recipe NDB_No starting too low in vicinity of USDA NDB_Nos.  Should
           start at 99000.  RecipeSaveAs changed.

2014-09-17 NUTsqlite-1.1 released.

2014-09-15 Forgot that calorie change from Calorie Auto-Set will not provoke
           auto portion control processing because calories not a PCF nutrient.
           Added auto_cal calls if calories change in AcceptNewMeasurements.

2014-09-10 AcceptNewMeasurements not working right because sql is not updating
           global variables from the proc.  No idea why not.  Added redundant
           call to RefreshWeightLog to update vars and it worked.  No idea why.

2014-09-10 Fixed spelling errors in nutdoc.html.  Made updateNUT.tcl delete
           from tcl_code before loading new code.

2014-09-07 NUTsqlite-1.0 released.
