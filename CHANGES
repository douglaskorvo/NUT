2014-10-03 NUTsqlite-1.6 released.

2014-10-03 Removed redundant SQL processing from proc update_am in case where
           user types giant number that resolves to all the meals in the db.

2014-10-03 A Windows and Mac user had to set appSize to 0.0.  So I guess I will
           distribute it set to 0.0 and make the Linux people be the ones who
           have to edit nut.tcl to change it.

2014-09-30 NUTsqlite-1.5 released.

2014-09-30 Added goofy acknowledgement message after updateNUT.tcl processing.

2014-09-30 Fixed the meal choice scale and food search widgets from changing
           their positions when going from meal to analysis in record meals.

2014-09-29 View pcf changed to temp.  Although NUT wasn't designed to work to
           with multiple instances sharing the same db, they shouldn't actively
           interfere if it can be helped, and pcf view won't be shared if it's
           temp.

2014-09-29 Heh heh, RecipeDone still doesn't work right.  Made random changes in
           hopes it will start to work.  My usual superficial testing confirms
           it may work, but maybe not.

2014-09-27 Added code to work with older Tcl/Tk/SQLite installations circa 2009
           that don't have SQLite restore and backup commands.

2014-09-26 NUTsqlite-1.4 released.

2014-09-26 Speeded up automatic portion control by making it a single SQL
           transaction.

2014-09-26 Speeded up proc SetDefanal slightly by cancelling previous calls on
           event loop and making shorter the time allowed for user spinbuttoning
           until SQL processing kicks in.

2014-09-25 Fixed setPCF to correctly show no portion control when it is
           obviously impossible.

2014-09-24 NUTsqlite-1.3 released.
 
2014-09-24 In some cases when carb or fat is set in personal options to "adjust
           to my meals" there is an error dialog when the nutrient is selected
           for automatic portion control.  Fixed in proc setPCF.

2014-09-18 NUTsqlite-1.2 released.

2014-09-18 Recipe scaling for water gained or lost in preparation is wrong.
           Nothing is happening.  RecipeDone changed.  Removed "-strict" from
           checking for doubles and fixed weight assignment that had wrong
           syntax.

2014-09-18 Recipe NDB_No starting too low in vicinity of USDA NDB_Nos.  Should
           start at 99000.  RecipeSaveAs changed.

2014-09-17 NUTsqlite-1.1 released.

2014-09-15 Forgot that calorie change from Calorie Auto-Set will not provoke
           auto portion control processing because calories not a PCF nutrient.
           Added auto_cal calls if calories change in AcceptNewMeasurements.

2014-09-10 AcceptNewMeasurements not working right because sql is not updating
           global variables from the proc.  No idea why not.  Added redundant
           call to RefreshWeightLog to update vars and it worked.  No idea why.

2014-09-10 Fixed spelling errors in nutdoc.html.  Made updateNUT.tcl delete
           from tcl_code before loading new code.

2014-09-07 NUTsqlite-1.0 released.
